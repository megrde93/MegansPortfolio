          Hiya! My name is Megan and it's great to meet you! I am a web
          developer based in southern Florida. In my free time I love playing
          videos games, particularly strategy ones, and reading books of all
          types. Iâ€™ve been accused of being a horrible cook but an excellent
          baker, which confuses everyone, most of all me. I have a West Highland
          Terrier named Buffy who adores me, and a cat named Mousse who mostly
          tolerates my existence as a necessary part of dinner time.
