          Hiya! My name is Megan and it's great to meet you! I am a web
          developer based in southern Florida. In my free time I love playing
          videos games, particularly strategy ones, and reading books of all
          types. Iâ€™ve been accused of being a horrible cook but an excellent
          baker, which confuses everyone, most of all me. I have a West Highland
          who adores me, and a cat who mostly tolerates my existence as a
          necessary part of dinner time.
          <break />I started in web design after spending several years in
          Systems Technician jobs. I was motivated by my desire to create
          something new. My favorite technologies to work with are React,
          tailwind and square space. Are you looking for someone to work on a
          web development project? Contact me to get started!
