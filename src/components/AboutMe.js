      <h2>
        Hiya! My name is Megan and it's great to meet you! I am a web developer
        based in southern Florida. In my free time I love playing videos games,
        particularly strategy ones, and reading books of all types. Iâ€™ve been
        accused of being a horrible cook but an excellent baker, which confuses
        everyone, most of all me. I have a West Highland Terrier named Buffy who
        adores me and likes Saturday morning trips to the dog park, and a cat
        named Mousse who mostly tolerates my existence as a necessary part of
        dinner time.
